Welcome to the main branch :

Here is how to push to git 

1. Everyone creates a branch : "git branch <yourname>"

2. Commit only when you checked out YOUR branch : git checkout <yourname>"

3. Pull from the main branch to see if someone pushed before you "git pull main"

4. If merge conflicts, resolve them (good luck <3)

5. Then just push "git push <yourname> main" (<yourname> is your branch)
